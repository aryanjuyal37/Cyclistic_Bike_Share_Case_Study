## Project Overview

In this case study, we investigate how annual members and casual riders use Cyclistic bikes differently. We aim to develop insights that will help Cyclistic in converting casual riders into annual members. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, and visualization.

## Data

The data used in this study is obtained from Divvy, a Chicago-based bike-share firm. It includes historical trip data from November 2021 to October 2022. The dataset is organized by month and year, and it contains information about ride duration, start and end stations, user types, and bike types.

## Analysis

The analysis involves comparing the usage patterns, ride lengths, and ride frequency between annual members and casual riders. Various data analysis techniques and visualizations are used to gain insights into the differences and preferences of these two user groups.

## Results

The analysis revealed several key findings, including the average ride lengths, peak ride times for different user types, and popular starting and ending stations. These insights will guide the development of a marketing strategy to encourage casual riders to become annual members.
